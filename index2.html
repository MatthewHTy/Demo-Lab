        <h3>Eat 3 to 6 Times a Day</h3>
        
        This will help boost metabolism so you will be burning calories and melting fat all day long. Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with planned snacks in between for when you are hungry. This will keep your blood sugar level stable all day to maximize your energy. In the long-run, this will prevent extreme hunger, and will prevent binge eating.

        <h3>Combine Carbs, Protein and Plants with each Meal</h3>

        Every meal you consume should include protein, carbohydrate sources and either a fruit or a vegetable. This combination is easier for your body to break down and is less likely to be stored as fat. This also helps to boost your metabolism, energy levels and meal satisfaction. You shouldn't feel hungry.

        <h3>Include Fats with your Meal</h3>

        Steer clear of unhealthy fats which can be found in common foods like pizza, burgers, cream sauces, fried foods, desserts and pastries etc.
