    <p>
        <h3>Eat 3 to 6 Times a Day</h3>
        
        This will help boost metabolism so you will be burning calories and melting fat all day long. Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with planned snacks in between for when you are hungry. This will keep your blood sugar level stable all day to maximize your energy. In the long-run, this will prevent extreme hunger, and will prevent binge eating.
        
    </p>
    <p>

        <h3>Combine Carbs, Protein and Plants with each Meal</h3>

        Every meal you consume should include protein, carbohydrate sources and either a fruit or a vegetable. This combination is easier for your body to break down and is less likely to be stored as fat. This also helps to boost your metabolism, energy levels and meal satisfaction. You shouldn't feel hungry.

    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Include Fats with your Meal</h3>

        Steer clear of unhealthy fats which can be found in common foods like pizza, burgers, cream sauces, fried foods, desserts and pastries etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Appropriate Portions</h3>
        If you are constantly finding yourself feeling stuffed, going for seconds or thirds leaving with a clean plate you are likely overeating. Consider portion controlling and trying out new recipes in order to combat overeating.

    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Plan Fruit or Vegetable Snacks</h3>
        Plan snacks in gaps between meals where you often get hungry.

    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Grocery Shop and Plan Meals in Advance</h3>
        Grocery shop at least once a week and have a consistent day where you plan all your meals.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Drink Water Regularly
    </h3>
    It is extremely important to stay well hydrateed to grow lean muscle and manage hunger levels. Lean uscle keeps your metabolism up and helps to burn fat. A good rule of thumb is to drink about half your body weight in ounces per day.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Manage Sweets and Drinks</h3>
    Avoid sodas and juices. They will pack on calories with little to no nutritional benefit. For the most part, avoid sweets and treats and choose a healthy alternative like a piece of fruit. Don't settle for cookies, cakes, doughnuts, etc. that are just sitting around your house or workplace. Make the committment to only have sweets on social occasions or when an extravagant dessert comes around that you don't want to miss out on. Also, avoid acloholic beverages, especially those with high calories.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Accountability</h3>
    Check in with yourself weekly on your progress. The more you hold yourself accountable, the better the results.
